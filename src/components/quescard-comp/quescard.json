Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a specific type of terrain: flat land, mountain, lake, or wildfire. Harry's objective is to escape the forest, starting from cell (0, 0) and reaching the destination cell (m-1, n-1) in the minimum possible time.</p>\r\n<p>He has a limited number of hearts represented by k. Crossing a wildfire cell consumes a heart, and if he has no hearts left, he will die. The magic spell allows him to rewind time when he crosses a cell containing a lake. The amount of time he can rewind depends on his current number of hearts. If the current number of hearts is even, he can rewind time by 2 minutes, else by 1 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>The terrain description is as follows:</p>\r\n<p>0: Flat Land - Represents flat land that can be traversed in 1 minute.</p>\r\n<p>1: Lake - Represents a lake cell that takes 2 minutes to cross. Additionally, when crossing a lake cell, Harry can rewind time depending on his current number of hearts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2: Wildfire - Represents a wildfire cell that consumes a heart when crossed. Harry can't enter a wildfire cell if he has no hearts left. It takes 1 min to cross the wildfire cell.</p>\r\n<p>3 to 1000: Mountain - Represents a mountain cell that takes (forest[i][j]%3) minutes to cross, where forest[i][j] is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Calculate the minimum time in which Harry can reach the destination cell, considering the constraints and rules mentioned above.</p>",
